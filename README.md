# Network Topologies Using Cisco Packet Tracer  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project showcases **two custom network topologies** designed and implemented in **Cisco Packet Tracer**. These topologies are structured to demonstrate advanced network design principles, including efficient routing, redundancy, and scalability.  

## 🏗️ Custom Topologies Implemented  
1. **[Custom Topology 1]** - *(Image Included in the Files)*  
2. **[Custom Topology 2]** - *(Image Included in the Files)*  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `/Topologies/` - Contains `.pkt` files for both custom topologies.  
- `/Documentation/` - Contains network diagrams and descriptions of each topology.  
- `/Configs/` - Includes CLI configurations for routers and switches (if applicable).  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** installed. *(Download from [Cisco NetAcad](https://www.netacad.com/))*  

### Steps to Run  
1. Open **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
2. Load the **.pkt** file from the **Topologies** folder.  
3. Inspect device configurations and run tests (e.g., `ping`, `traceroute`).  

## 📊 Features  
✅ **Custom-designed** network structures for real-world scenarios.  
✅ **Routing & Switching Concepts** demonstrated.  
✅ **Scalability & Redundancy** tested with simulations.  

## 📝 Future Enhancements  
- Adding **dynamic routing protocols** (OSPF, EIGRP).  
- Implementing **security measures** (ACLs, firewalls).  
- Simulating **real-world enterprise setups**.  

## 📜 License  
This project is **open-source** and available for educational use.
